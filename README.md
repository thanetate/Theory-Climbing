## Background

As someone who’s passionate about rock climbing, I’ve wanted to create my own brand for years, and this project has given me the opportunity to finally bring that vision to life. Although the site is live, I’m still actively working on refining and enhancing it. Being a computer science student at the University of North Texas, this project has been an incredible way to deepen my knowledge of full-stack web development while combining it with my passion for climbing.
